1.a SQL databases are based on a relational data model, where data is stored in tables with rows and columns, and relationships between tables are established using foreign keys.
1.b SQL databases typically enforce a rigid schema, where the structure of the data (the tables, columns, and data types) must be defined before data can be inserted.
1.c SQL databases use SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and manipulating data, which is a standardized language for relational databases.
1.d SQL databases are traditionally scaled vertically, meaning you increase the resources (CPU, RAM, etc.) of a single server to handle increased load.
1.e SQL databases are well-suited for applications with complex queries, transactions, and where data integrity is critical, such as banking systems, ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems, etc.

2.a NoSQL databases employ various data models such as document-based, key-value pairs, column-family, or graph-based, allowing more flexibility in data representation.
2.b NoSQL databases often use a schema-less or flexible schema approach, allowing for dynamic changes to the data structure without needing to modify the entire database schema.
2.c NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, allowing you to distribute data across multiple servers to handle larger amounts of data and higher throughput.
2d NoSQL databases may sacrifice some level of ACID compliance in favor of performance and scalability, although some NoSQL databases do offer ACID transactions for certain operations.
2.e NoSQL databases use various query languages or APIs specific to their data model. For example, MongoDB uses a query language similar to JSON for its document-based model.
